    <p>Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha.<br> Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity.<br> To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components.<br> Such a unique definition is derived here.<br> When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha × beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices.<br> The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. <br>The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity.<br> Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.</p>

    <p>Previous studies on fossil marine mammal biogeography have identified several key geographical routes hypothesized to play a prominent role in their dispersal.<br> This study aims to assess the degree to which each route plays a role.<br> Data on fossil marine mammal temporal and geographic distributions were derived from the Paleobiology Database.<br> Faunal similarity was high between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic but relatively low between the Mediterranean and the Pacific.<br> Faunal similarity was observed across both halves of the North Pacific for all four groups in this study.<br> Modern high similarity values between the Atlantic and the Pacific were not observed in the fossil record and were established in the Quaternary.<br> The Strait of Gibraltar is shown to be a pivotal passageway for the dispersal of marine mammals, first in the Eocene as sirenians and cetaceans leave the Tethys Sea, and again as marine mammals reinvade the Mediterranean following the Messinian Salinity Crisis.<br> The Central American Seaway plays only a minor role in marine mammal dispersal.<br> Modern faunal similarity is the result of recent dispersal events in the Quaternary through the Arctic Ocean.</p>

    <p>We observed robust coupling between the high- and low-frequency bands of ongoing electrical activity in the human brain.<br> In particular, the phase of the low-frequency theta (4 to 8 hertz) rhythm modulates power in the high gamma (80 to 150 hertz) band of the electrocorticogram, with stronger modulation occurring at higher theta amplitudes.<br> Furthermore, different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns of theta/high gamma coupling across the cortex.<br> The results indicate that transient coupling between low- and high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates activity in distributed cortical areas, providing a mechanism for effective communication during cognitive processing in humans.</p>
